# Fast Track Weekend

Welcome to our October edition of Fast Track! First of all, we hope that you find yourselves safe and healthy during these difficult times. We are so grateful and excited that you have decided to join us this weekend to learn about our community and to embark on your tech journey! We hope you have a great experience and that you learn a lot.

Today will consist of 4 rotations that each include a small lecture followed by a set amount of time to work on some labs with your peers. We'll break for half hour after the 2nd rotation in order to get some brain food! 

The second day will begin with a quick review of Day 1. Then, it will consist of 2 rotations in the morning followed by lunch and then time in the afternoon for working on labs.

**Day 1 Topics:**

We will be getting into Ruby and handling error messages that come up as we program. Then we'll transition into learning about data types and variables in Ruby. From there, we'll go more into depth into a super popular data structure called an array. Then to wrap up the day, we're going to get into logic and conditionals in programming.

**Day 2 Topics:**

We will be reviewing Day 1 topics. We'll also have one new topic, iteration. The rest of the day will be spent working in groups on projects to apply the skills you've learned over the weekend. We'll end the weekend with an assessment where you'll have the chance to demonstrate what you learned! 

**A Note on Labs**

In the schedule below, there's time built in for working on labs. The labs you’ll be working on for the weekend are available on the Technical Application - Ruby track on [learn.co](learn.co). You don't have to complete every single lab during the time allotted - focus on the labs listed out in the schedule for each section!
