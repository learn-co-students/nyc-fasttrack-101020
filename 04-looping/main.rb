# 1. Print out the numbers 1-100
# 2. Print out only the even numbers 1-100 (hint: 1 % 2 == 1 && 2 % 2 == 0)
# 3. Print out the numbers 1-100, but for every number divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
# 4. Same as before, but for numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
# 5. Same as before, but for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
# 6. Add the numbers 1-100 to an array
# 7. Add only the even numbers from 1-100 to an array
# 8. Add the squares of the first 100 numbers to an array
